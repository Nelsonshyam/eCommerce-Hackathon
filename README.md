# Ecommerce Product Categorization Hackathon

Welcome to the "Ecommerce Product Categorization" hackathon, hosted by KnowledgeHut! This exciting competition challenges participants to solve a real-world retail problem by applying advanced data science, machine learning, and NLP techniques. The goal is to build a multi-class text classifier that predicts product categories using product descriptions.



## Objective
